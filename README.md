# Physics-Sim-ML 
A repo for my physics-based simulation and machine learning projects.
## Current Projects:
### PHLUID (PHhysics Learning Under Image Detection)
1. Predicting the time evolution of the Swarmalator system (https://www.complexity-explorables.org/explorables/swarmalators/) using a Convolutional Autoencoder paired with a Recurrent Neural Network in Python.
### ROCFPH (ReservOir-Computing For PHysics)
1. Building a preliminary RC network in Julia on the Lorentz system.
## Future projects:
### PHLUID
1. Predicting the time evolution of fluid-flow simulations.
2. Predicting the time evolution of a very large N-body gravity simulation.
3. Predicting the time evolution of a chaotic system (e.g., spring pendulum)
### ROCFPH
1. Refining the RC network and expanding to Chua's circuit.
2. Implementing a network of quantum harmonic oscillators.
