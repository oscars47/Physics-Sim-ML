# Physics-Sim-ML
A repo for my physics-based simulation and machine learning projects.
## Current Projects:
1. Predicting the time evolution of the Swarmalator system (https://www.complexity-explorables.org/explorables/swarmalators/) using a Convolutional Autoencoder paired with a Recurrent Neural Network.
## Future projects:
1. Predicting the time evolution of fluid-flow simulations.
2. Predicting the time evolution of a very large N-body gravity simulation.
3. Predicting the time evolution of a chaotic system (e.g., spring pendulum)
