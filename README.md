# Physics-Sim-ML 
A repo for my physics-based simulation and machine learning projects.
## Current Projects:
### ROCFPH (ReservOir-Computing For PHysics)
1. NG-RC + QHO, P.1
  a). Simulating a variety of dynamical systems (e.g., Double Scroll, Lorenz Attractor for chaotic dynamics) to prepare input data
  b). Building a Next Generation Reservoir Computer, a Nonlinear Vector Autoregressor (NVAR)
  c). Training and validating my NG-RC
## Future projects:
### ROCFPH
1. NG-RC + QHO, P.2
a. Extending the results of the NG-RC to a network of quantum harmonic oscillators.
2. NG-RC + NS
a. Extending the results of the NG-RC to data generated from the Navier-Stokes equations.

## For later:
### PHLUID (PHhysics Learning Under Image Detection)
* Need to resolve memory issue with the image approach *
1. Predicting the time evolution of the Swarmalator system (https://www.complexity-explorables.org/explorables/swarmalators/) using a Convolutional Autoencoder paired with a Recurrent Neural Network in Python. (in progress)
2. Predicting the time evolution of fluid-flow simulations.
3. Predicting the time evolution of a very large N-body gravity simulation.
4. Predicting the time evolution of a chaotic system (e.g., spring pendulum)
